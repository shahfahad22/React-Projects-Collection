# 🎨 React + TailwindCSS Color Changer App

A simple and interactive **Color Changer App** built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **React Hooks** (`useState`) for state management and Tailwind utility classes for styling.

- Multiple color options (`Red`, `Blue`, `Crimson`, `Turquoise`, `Coral`, `Plum`, `Black`).
